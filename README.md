# Travel-Tracker Part 1 - Joey

## Abstract:
Travel-Tracker is an app that lets a user schedule a date for travel. The user also has the option of destination, trip duration, and choosing an amount of travelers to travel with. This project displays a login screen that takes a username and password, before logging in the user to their own dashboard. Their is an approved, pending, and past trips display on the dashboard. Once a a trip is submitted, a widget will show an image of the destination with a quick calculation showing the expense of the trip. There is also a widget that shows the amount of money that particular user has spent within the last year. The year is dynamic, so it only tracks the last 365 days and will continously update as each day passes.

Copy the link it provides that will look like this: http://localhost:8080/
Paste that into your web browser of choice
Go to this link: ("https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api")
Click the green < code > button.
Copy the SSH to your terminal.
Create a new directory with your clone link.
cd into the directory.
Run npm install.
Run npm start.
You should see that the local server is now running. You will now be getting data to populate into the 8080 link.
Enjoy!

## Context:
This solo project was the final project for mod2. It took me appoximately 70 hours to complete in its current iteration. There were many difficulties for me during this project. But in the end, I was able to overcome all the most difficult tasks that stood infront of me. I now believe I have a good base to continue to build off of in the future. Both literally in the project and in the knowledge I have accrued. I truly felt tested with this project but was able to put everything together in the end after a slow start to the module.

## Learning Goals:

* Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.

* Create a user interface that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way.

* Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.

* Make network requests to retrieve data.

* Collaborate productively and professionally as a team. Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project.

## Major Wins:
### Joey:
A major win was being able to complete the project. I wasn't sure if I really could. But all the major milstones that I wanted to accomplish, I did. One was refactoring, GET and POST requests, being able to create unit tests and really utilizing iterator methods. Though I still wish I used more of them. 

## Challenges and How We Overcame Them:
### Joey:
My biggest challenge was the DOM. It has been a bit of thorn in my side since the start of my coding journey. I had gotten too far ahead of myself and focused too hard on making the code work instead of making it more symanitc, dynamic, and properly organized. I had accidentally interwoven my logic and DOM functions into one big mess. It worked, but there was no way I could tests effectively. But after a long time and a lot frustation, the solution came to me and I was able to parse the functions and reconstruct to be able to post them on the webpage. In the end, it still messier than I'd like, but I feel an immense sense of accomplishment for doing that part on my own and really feel like I have taken a turn in my coding career.
