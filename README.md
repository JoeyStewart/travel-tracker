# Fit Lit Part 1 - Joey, Zen, Lex

## Abstract:

FitLit is a project that focuses on building an intuitive dashboard for activity tracking, inspired by fitness apps like Fitbit. It aims to use object and array prototype methods for data manipulation, create a user-friendly interface, write reusable code, and implement a comprehensive testing suite. The project involves processing data from activity trackers for multiple users over various days, presenting it in a clear and informative manner.

Web development tools, including Webpack, are used to streamline the project. It's vital to configure Webpack to locate files correctly and utilize import/export syntax for modular code. The project's requirements include using the FitLit Starter Kit repository and setting up testing with mocha and chai.

FitLit consists of multiple iterations, focusing on different aspects of data processing and dashboard display, including user data, hydration, sleep, and activity. It encourages fetching data from provided endpoints instead of hardcoded data files. While third-party libraries like Day.js or Chart.js are optional, instructor approval is advised.

The project also provides an extension option for building a robust testing suite, ensuring the project's quality and functionality. In summary, FitLit aims to deliver a user-friendly fitness dashboard for tracking activity data, fostering collaboration and professionalism among team members.

## Context:
This was the first group project in Mod 2 that we had to assemble. We used webpacks as well as fetch requests to store variables for future use and that allowed us to populate every field of this Fitness Tracker. We had 10 days to complete the project spent about 90 hours cumulatively working togeher collaboratively. Part of the difficulty of the project came from learning new concepts such as the fetch requests and then having to utilize them in the same day. Even in spite of this, the project was completed several days in advance of the project deadline allowing time for bug fixes.

## Learning Goals:

* Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.

* Create a user interface that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way.

* Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.

* Make network requests to retrieve data.

* Collaborate productively and professionally as a team. Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project.

## Major Wins:
### Joey:
I was able to create a skeleton for our webpage with the use of html and css. These had been my weaker areas in previous projects, but I feel that I have vastly improved on my methods in the construction phase. I have also been able to move away from using divs. Using them more sparingly. Learning how to quickly do fetch requests with my group was enlightening and I feel I can do them with speed and few issues going forward.

## Challenges and How We Overcame Them:
### Joey:
Understanding how to manipulate the DOM and use it effectively was a challenge. Balancing out how to import which functions to their needed folders left me confused during the earlier stages of the project. Once we had figured out a path in connecting our functions to the DOM, things became much smoother and easier for the rest of the project.
